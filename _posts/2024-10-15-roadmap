So, where should I begin?

A typical roadmap would consist of a tree of topics, mainly knowledge and skill based, that just ends with an arbitrary interview prep and after that you are free to do anything you wish. That is too generalized and does not include various factors such as job market situation, personal background and other things that I may not be aware of right now.
