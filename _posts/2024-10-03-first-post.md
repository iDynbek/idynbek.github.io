# First post

Hello!

This is my first post in this blog.

Probably, I should start from an introduction of myself. My name is Aidynbek, and I want to be a data scientist.

I will be documenting anything I find and learn about data science, so feel free to add this page to your bookmarks! Of course, at the beginning it will be mostly basic stuff, but I want to reach the point where I can read cutting edge research.

My main goals with writing a blog is to discipline myself to make as much progress in as little time as possible and improve my writing and soft skills, as I believe these things are essential if you want to work in data related field (and in life in general). Also it is nice to have something to showcase beside your CV :D.

For starters, I managed to successfully set up this website, so now my next goal is to fill it with content. Next thing I will do is to probably add a CV page.

Anyways, I am finished for today, hope you will have great time exploring my little blog!
